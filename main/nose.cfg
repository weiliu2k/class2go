#  ./manage.py test --config=nose.cfg

# Note, the verbose flag cannot be set in this file, it must

#  ./manage.py test --config=nose.cfg -v 2

# One other optimization is to set REUSE_DB=1 in your env
# so that the database is reused rather than needing to go
# through the entire creation and migration steps.
#  REUSE_DB=1 ./manage.py test --config=nose.cfg -v 2
